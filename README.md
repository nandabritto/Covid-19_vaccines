## Existing Features 

+ The landing page image

Covid-19 vaccine bottles were used to catch user attention to the website subject.
<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/eff4eb18f4495e61609198a76d83896ecd1dea4a/header.png">

+ Navigation Bar 

 Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Importance, Types and Efficacy page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. The navbar has a sticky feature, so user can easily access any part of the website anytime.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/eff4eb18f4495e61609198a76d83896ecd1dea4a/navbar%20(2).png">

+ Importance page

This section is divided into four sub-items and will be updated when new vaccines roll out. 
The user can navigate and get fully informed about:

   1. How are vaccines help our body fighting against diseases;  
   
   <img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/eff4eb18f4495e61609198a76d83896ecd1dea4a/why.png">
   
   2. How they are developed;
     
<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/eff4eb18f4495e61609198a76d83896ecd1dea4a/how-it-works.png">

A youtube video was used to make this abstract scientific content more understandable for all people. The user can watch the video on full screen and have all the controls available. 

   3. The importance of getting vaccinated for world health;
   
<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/eff4eb18f4495e61609198a76d83896ecd1dea4a/importance.png">

   4. The reason covid-19 vaccine was produced faster than other vaccines.
   
An image was added to compare other vaccines and the Covid-19 vaccine's development. This image was chosen to make it easier for the user to understand that no steps were skipped by scientists during the Covid-19 vaccines development process.

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/4adc49a542b2d324d9cb5b23ad7c45013d268f83/development%20(2).png">
<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/4adc49a542b2d324d9cb5b23ad7c45013d268f83/why-so-faster.png">

+ Types page

At the very beginning of this page, users can find three buttons. When they click on the button, it leads to each vaccine's type explanation. 

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/4adc49a542b2d324d9cb5b23ad7c45013d268f83/buttons-desktop.png">

All the buttons are responsive and adapt to user's screen size.

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/4adc49a542b2d324d9cb5b23ad7c45013d268f83/inactivated-virus.png">

All images on this project have a click to enlarge feature. The user can check all the details of each image or scheme.This feature is responsive and availabe in all screen sizes.  

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/4adc49a542b2d324d9cb5b23ad7c45013d268f83/enlarge-images.png">

+ Efficiency 

This section has a slideshow that presents users with a brief comparison of the efficacy of the most used Covid-19 vaccines around the world. User can choose when to click to move forwards or backwards, or just watch while images roll out. 

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/4adc49a542b2d324d9cb5b23ad7c45013d268f83/slideshow.png">

After the slideshow, a text related to images on the slideshow, gives a brief explanation about each vaccine efficacy.

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/4adc49a542b2d324d9cb5b23ad7c45013d268f83/efficacy-text.png">

+ Footer 

The footer section includes links to easily share this website with other people on relevant social media sites and email.
The links will open to a new tab to keep users on this page while allowing easy navigation to share content. 

<img src="https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/4adc49a542b2d324d9cb5b23ad7c45013d268f83/footer.png">

The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to share information about Covid-19 vaccines. 

## Future Features 

I would like to add a hamburger navbar for smaller devices, this will make the project more responsive. 
Besides that, new vaccines will be added that have been approved and used worldwide, this will make the information about the Covid-19 vaccine relevant to people anywhere.

6 warnings were found on the validation process. Custom properties were used to ensure that DRY principle was upheld and all warnings concerns the root colours code. 
  
   The warnings can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/d66ce3892f48e490419692b20a465ab701d6c72f/images/readme_images/warnings-css.png)
     
### Manual Testing

   + Desktop

 Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge: everything is working good. Page loads and all of the page features are working.

   + Mobile
 
 Tested with Samsumg A30, Xiaomi Mi6, Xiaomi Mi8 and webpage works well. It responsive as intended and with no page deformations.

   + Mozilla Dev Tools
 
 Tested for available devices, webpage works well. It is responsive as intended, with no page deformations.
 
 ## Accessibility tests
 
 The entire website was verified about accessibility using [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

   + Errors

      - On the 3 pages, Wave showed errors that can be viewed [here]() The lightbox error code can be viewed here(https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/a8cca63a6167e490b614a4619846f690e302f614/images/readme_images/accessibility-error.png). All of them related to [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/lightbox2) code used for click to enlarge images. 
   
The alerts for each page can be viewed on the links:

[Importance](https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/9f4e9090d84678ac6e0544cf40822b458edde267/images/readme_images/alerts-importance.png)

[Types](https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/9f4e9090d84678ac6e0544cf40822b458edde267/images/readme_images/alerts-types.png)

[Efficacy](https://github.com/nandabritto/MS1/blob/b476726ab4cc5d5a2731da8f05fd2ea66f92707f/images/readme_images/alerts-efficacy.png)

 + Alerts

   - The redundant link alert showed in all the pages was a design choice, to allow the user easy access (reload the page and go to the head).
   - The small texts alerts showed on all pages were used by design choice to footer and source credits for the texts.
   - Youtube video alert can be ignored because the video has good quality embedded subtitles which allow accessibility needed.
   - Device dependent alert can be ignored because the carousel slideshow has a feature that auto flip images after few seconds.
 
 ## Project Bugs and Solutions:

When viewed for the 1st time on the [AmIResponsive](ami.responsivedesign.is) website, it was noticed that navbar was split into two lines on smaller devices (iPhone 5). This bug was caused as a result of unsetting different font size for smaller devices screen, which caused it to unformat the navbar on older smaller devices like the iPhone 5. 

This bug was fixed by changing the font-size for smaller devices which maintain the integrity of the navbar on the mobile view.

  ## Deployment

 The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 
 
 * The steps to deploy are as follows: 

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab; 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch;
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
